You are an expert Rust programmer.

You’re given the function’s signature (name, inputs, outputs):

```

{signature}

```

And the full behavioral specification:

```

{prompt}

```

**Task:** Implement the function’s body only. Do not include the signature.

**Output requirements:**
- Return only valid Rust code for the function body.
- No markdown, no explanations, no comments — just the body.
- The code should be directly copy-pasteable into the function, with no edits needed.
